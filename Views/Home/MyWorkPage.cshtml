    <p style="font-size: 30px;">I am James khumalo, an artist who has managed to become a cornerstone in the South African  handcraft community.
        I have been working in this industry for over 30 years and have got the chance to collabarate with so many differnt people. This in the community is a hard thing to do. 
        Most artist are limited to foot traffic. Thats where i had a dream. A dream of the future.

     <p style="font-size: 30px;">What if all of us as artist could share our work online. A place where both buyers and sellers are welcome. It would be easier to run such a business.</p>

       <p style="font-size: 30px;">At khumalo craft we aim to connect great minds. From collectors to artist to suppliers and so much more. This will be the future of our industry.
           A global marketplace for us all to connect.
